## Usage
To use a specific design pattern in your own Java project, you can copy the relevant package from this project and modify it to suit your needs.

Each package contains a README.md file that describes the design pattern being implemented, its purpose, the problems it solves, and the benefits it provides. Additionally, each package contains a set of example classes that demonstrate how to use the design pattern in practice.
