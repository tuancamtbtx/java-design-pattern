The Flyweight Design Pattern is a structural design pattern aimed at minimizing memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects. It is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that share common data. The pattern achieves this by storing the shared data externally and passing it to the flyweight objects when needed.

### Key Concepts

1. **Flyweight**: The interface or abstract class that defines the methods for the flyweight objects.
2. **ConcreteFlyweight**: The class that implements the Flyweight interface and stores intrinsic state (shared state).
3. **UnsharedConcreteFlyweight**: Sometimes, not all flyweight objects can be shared. These objects store extrinsic state (unique state) and are not shared.
4. **FlyweightFactory**: The factory that creates and manages flyweight objects. It ensures that flyweights are shared properly.
5. **Client**: The class that uses flyweight objects. It usually stores or computes the extrinsic state and passes it to the flyweight objects.

### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic State

- **Intrinsic State**: The state that is shared among multiple objects. This state is stored in the flyweight object.
- **Extrinsic State**: The state that is unique to each object. This state is stored or computed by the client and passed to the flyweight object.

### Example

Let's consider an example where we need to create a large number of `Tree` objects in a forest. Each tree has a type, color, texture, and coordinates. The type, color, and texture are shared (intrinsic state), while the coordinates are unique (extrinsic state).

#### Flyweight Interface

```java
public interface Tree {
    void draw(int x, int y);
}
```

#### ConcreteFlyweight

```java
public class TreeType implements Tree {
    private String name;
    private String color;
    private String texture;

    public TreeType(String name, String color, String texture) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
        this.texture = texture;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw(int x, int y) {
        System.out.println("Drawing a " + name + " tree at (" + x + ", " + y + ") with color " + color + " and texture " + texture);
    }
}
```

#### Flyweight Factory

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class TreeFactory {
    private static Map<String, Tree> treeTypes = new HashMap<>();

    public static Tree getTreeType(String name, String color, String texture) {
        String key = name + "-" + color + "-" + texture;
        if (!treeTypes.containsKey(key)) {
            treeTypes.put(key, new TreeType(name, color, texture));
        }
        return treeTypes.get(key);
    }
}
```

#### Client

```java
public class Forest {
    private List<Tree> trees = new ArrayList<>();

    public void plantTree(int x, int y, String name, String color, String texture) {
        Tree treeType = TreeFactory.getTreeType(name, color, texture);
        trees.add(new TreeLocation(x, y, treeType));
    }

    public void draw() {
        for (Tree tree : trees) {
            tree.draw();
        }
    }
}

class TreeLocation implements Tree {
    private int x, y;
    private Tree treeType;

    public TreeLocation(int x, int y, Tree treeType) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.treeType = treeType;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw() {
        treeType.draw(x, y);
    }
}
```

#### Main

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Forest forest = new Forest();
        forest.plantTree(1, 2, "Oak", "Green", "Rough");
        forest.plantTree(3, 4, "Pine", "Green", "Smooth");
        forest.plantTree(5, 6, "Oak", "Green", "Rough");
        forest.draw();
    }
}
```

### When to Use the Flyweight Pattern

1. **Large Number of Objects**: When you need to create a large number of similar objects.
2. **Memory Constraints**: When memory usage is a concern and you want to reduce it by sharing as much data as possible.
3. **Shared State**: When there is a significant amount of shared state among objects.

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Memory Usage**: By sharing common data, you can significantly reduce the amount of memory used.
2. **Improved Performance**: Less memory usage can lead to better performance, especially in memory-constrained environments.

### Drawbacks

1. **Complexity**: Introduces additional complexity in the code due to the need to manage shared and unique states.
2. **Overhead**: There is a slight overhead in managing the flyweight objects and their factory.

### Conclusion

The Flyweight Design Pattern is a powerful tool for optimizing memory usage in applications that need to handle a large number of similar objects. By sharing common data, it can help you achieve significant memory savings and improve overall performance.
