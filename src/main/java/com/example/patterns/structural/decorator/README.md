The Decorator design pattern is a structural pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. The pattern is useful for adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.

### Key Concepts

1. **Component**: The interface or abstract class defining the methods that can be dynamically added to objects.
2. **Concrete Component**: The class that implements the `Component` interface. This is the object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
3. **Decorator**: An abstract class that implements the `Component` interface and contains a reference to a `Component` object. It forwards requests to the component and may perform additional actions before or after forwarding.
4. **Concrete Decorators**: Classes that extend the `Decorator` class and add responsibilities to the component.

### Example: Text Editor Features

Let's consider an example where we have a simple text editor, and we want to add additional features like spell checking and grammar checking using the Decorator pattern.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define the Component Interface**

```java
public interface TextEditor {
    void display();
}
```

2. **Implement the Concrete Component (Simple Text Editor)**

```java
public class SimpleTextEditor implements TextEditor {
    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying simple text editor.");
    }
}
```

3. **Create the Decorator Abstract Class**

```java
public abstract class TextEditorDecorator implements TextEditor {
    protected TextEditor decoratedTextEditor;

    public TextEditorDecorator(TextEditor decoratedTextEditor) {
        this.decoratedTextEditor = decoratedTextEditor;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        decoratedTextEditor.display();
    }
}
```

4. **Implement Concrete Decorators (Spell Check and Grammar Check)**

```java
public class SpellCheckDecorator extends TextEditorDecorator {
    public SpellCheckDecorator(TextEditor decoratedTextEditor) {
        super(decoratedTextEditor);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        decoratedTextEditor.display();
        addSpellCheck();
    }

    private void addSpellCheck() {
        System.out.println("Adding spell check feature.");
    }
}

public class GrammarCheckDecorator extends TextEditorDecorator {
    public GrammarCheckDecorator(TextEditor decoratedTextEditor) {
        super(decoratedTextEditor);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        decoratedTextEditor.display();
        addGrammarCheck();
    }

    private void addGrammarCheck() {
        System.out.println("Adding grammar check feature.");
    }
}
```

5. **Client Usage**

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextEditor editor = new SimpleTextEditor();

        // Adding spell check feature
        TextEditor spellCheckEditor = new SpellCheckDecorator(editor);
        spellCheckEditor.display();
        // Output:
        // Displaying simple text editor.
        // Adding spell check feature.

        // Adding grammar check feature on top of spell check
        TextEditor grammarCheckEditor = new GrammarCheckDecorator(spellCheckEditor);
        grammarCheckEditor.display();
        // Output:
        // Displaying simple text editor.
        // Adding spell check feature.
        // Adding grammar check feature.
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **TextEditor**: This is the component interface that declares the `display` method.
2. **SimpleTextEditor**: This is the concrete component that implements the `TextEditor` interface. It represents the basic functionality of a text editor.
3. **TextEditorDecorator**: This is the abstract decorator class that implements the `TextEditor` interface and contains a reference to a `TextEditor` object. It forwards the `display` method call to the decorated text editor.
4. **SpellCheckDecorator**: This is a concrete decorator that adds spell-checking functionality to the text editor.
5. **GrammarCheckDecorator**: This is another concrete decorator that adds grammar-checking functionality to the text editor.
6. **Client**: The client creates a simple text editor and then decorates it with spell-checking and grammar-checking features.

### Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Divides functionality among classes with unique areas of concern.
3. **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.

### Considerations

1. **Complexity**: The design can become complex with many small classes.
2. **Performance**: Multiple layers of decorators can add overhead and affect performance.

### Conclusion

The Decorator design pattern is a powerful tool for adding responsibilities to objects dynamically. It allows for flexible and reusable code by adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle and the Open/Closed Principle.
