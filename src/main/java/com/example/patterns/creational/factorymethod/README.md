# Factory Method
## Intent
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Comparison between Abstract Factory and Factory Method
| Criteria          | Abstract Factory                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Factory Method                                                                                                                                  |

| Type              | Creational                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Creational                                                                                                                                      |
| Purpose           | Creates families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.                                                                                                                                            | Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.                           |
| Use Case          | Useful when a system should be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. It allows a client to use an abstract interface to create a set of related objects without needing to know the concrete classes. | Suitable when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create. The Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. |
| Relationship      | Creates multiple related objects as a family.                                                                                                                                                                                          | Creates a single object of a family.                                                                                                            |
| Abstraction Level | Provides an additional layer of abstraction over Factory Method.                                                                                                                                                                       | Provides a single level of abstraction.                                                                                                         |
| Product Varieties | Produces multiple types of products, often grouped into families.                                                                                                                                                                      | Typically produces a single type of product.                                                                                                    |
| Structure         | Typically involves multiple factory classes, each responsible for creating a different family of related objects.                                                                                                                      | Usually consists of a single creator class and multiple concrete classes implementing the product creation.                                     |
| Flexibility       | Provides a higher level of flexibility, allowing the client to create multiple families of related products.                                                                                                                           | Offers a lower level of flexibility, focusing on creating individual objects with possible variations.                                          |
| Dependency        | Involves more complex dependencies and interactions between interrelated objects.                                                                                                                                                      | Generally involves simpler dependencies, often focusing on single objects.                                                                      |
| Example           | Creating GUI components such as buttons, windows, and panels that are compatible with each other.                                                                                                                                      | Creating a document editor where different types of documents can be created (e.g., PDF, Word, Text).                                           |
