# Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.
Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating all distinct products but leaves the actual product creation to concrete factory classes. Each factory type corresponds to a certain product variety.
The client code calls the creation methods of a factory object instead of creating products directly with a constructor call (new operator). Since a factory corresponds to a single product variant, all its products will be compatible.
Client code works with factories and products only through their abstract interfaces. This lets the client code work with any product variants, created by the factory object. You just create a new concrete factory class and pass it to the client code.

## Problem
Imagine that you are a UI app for other operating systems. Your code consists of classes that represent:
1. A family of UI elements, such as `checkboxes`, `buttons`.
2. Several variants of this family. For example, Checkboxes and Buttons are available in these variants: `Windows`, `MacOS`.

You need a way to create individual UI elements so that they match the operating system the app is running on.
Also, you don't want to change existing code when adding new  UI elements or families of UI elements to the program. You also might need to have the ability to switch between several variants of UI elements.
## Solution
The first thing the Abstract Factory pattern suggests is to explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family (e.g., button, checkbox). Then you can make all variants of products follow those interfaces. For example, all variants of checkboxes can implement the `Checkbox` interface; all variants of buttons can implement the `Button` interface, and so on.
The second thing is to declare the Abstract Factoryâ€”an interface with a list of creation methods for all products that are part of the product family (e.g., createButton, createCheckbox). These methods must return abstract product types represented by the interfaces we extracted previously: `Button`, `Checkbox`, and so on.
Now, how do we use these interfaces? Imagine that you are creating a new UI app. Your code contains a lot of classes for buttons, checkboxes, and other interface elements of the app. But you don't know beforehand what operating system your app will support. So, you don't know what actual classes you will have to instantiate within your code.
All you need is to pick a variant of the factory class that corresponds to the operating system you're targeting. For example, if you're targeting Windows, you create a WindowsFactory class; for MacOs, you create a MacOsFactory class, and so on. All these factory classes must implement the same interface, which declares methods for creating all the interface elements.
If you need to add a new variant of UI elements, you create a new class that implements the Abstract Factory interface.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros of Abstract Factory Pattern:
1. **Encapsulation**: It encapsulates the creation of families of related or dependent objects, ensuring that the created objects are compatible and properly configured.
2. **Isolation of Concrete Classes**: It isolates the concrete classes from the client code, making it easier to replace the concrete factory and product classes without altering the client code.
3. **Consistency**: It ensures the consistency of the created objects within a family, as they are created by a single concrete factory ensuring compatibility and consistency.
4. **Flexibility**: It allows easy switching between different families of products by switching the concrete factory, making it easy to introduce new families of products.
5. **Maintenance and Scalability**: It simplifies maintenance and scalability, as it allows adding new variations or families of products without modifying existing client code.

### Cons of Abstract Factory Pattern:
1. **Complexity**: It can introduce increased complexity when multiple families of products and their variations are involved, potentially leading to a large number of related factory and product classes.
2. **Inflexibility with New Product Families**: It may be challenging to extend an abstract factory to support new families of products without modifying the existing code.
3. **Decoupling Challenges**: It can be challenging to decouple the client from the concrete factory and product classes, especially when the client needs to interact directly with the created objects.
4. **Overhead for Small Systems**: It may introduce unnecessary overhead and complexity for small systems with limited variations in the families of products.
5. **Learning Curve**: It may have a learning curve for developers who are new to the pattern, especially when dealing with complex families of products and variations.

When using the Abstract Factory pattern, it's essential to carefully evaluate its benefits and drawbacks within the context of the specific application or system. While it provides advantages in terms of encapsulation and flexibility, its potential limitations should be considered to ensure its effective and efficient use within a software system
