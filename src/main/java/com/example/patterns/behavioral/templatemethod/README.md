The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. This pattern is particularly useful when you have an invariant part of an algorithm that can be shared across multiple implementations, but some parts of the algorithm need to be customized.

### Key Concepts

1. **Abstract Class**: Defines the template method and the primitive operations. The template method is a concrete method that defines the algorithm's structure, and it calls the primitive operations, which are abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses.
2. **Concrete Class**: Implements the primitive operations to carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm.

### Example

Let's consider an example where we have a data processing system that reads data, processes it, and writes the results. The steps to read and write data are common, but the processing logic can vary.

#### Abstract Class

```java
public abstract class DataProcessor {
    // Template method
    public final void process() {
        readData();
        processData();
        writeData();
    }

    // Concrete method
    private void readData() {
        System.out.println("Reading data...");
    }

    // Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void processData();

    // Concrete method
    private void writeData() {
        System.out.println("Writing data...");
    }
}
```

#### Concrete Classes

```java
public class CSVDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing data as CSV...");
    }
}

public class XMLDataProcessor extends DataProcessor {
    @Override
    protected void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing data as XML...");
    }
}
```

#### Client

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DataProcessor csvProcessor = new CSVDataProcessor();
        csvProcessor.process();

        DataProcessor xmlProcessor = new XMLDataProcessor();
        xmlProcessor.process();
    }
}
```

### When to Use the Template Method Pattern

1. **Invariant Algorithm**: When you have an algorithm with invariant parts that can be shared, but some steps need to be customized by subclasses.
2. **Code Reuse**: When you want to promote code reuse by defining the common structure of an algorithm in a base class.
3. **Frameworks and Libraries**: When designing frameworks or libraries where you want to provide a default behavior that can be extended or overridden by clients.

### Benefits

1. **Code Reuse**: Promotes code reuse by defining the common structure of an algorithm in a base class.
2. **Flexibility**: Allows subclasses to customize specific steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.
3. **Consistency**: Ensures that the overall structure of the algorithm remains consistent across different implementations.

### Drawbacks

1. **Inheritance Overuse**: Can lead to an overuse of inheritance, making the system harder to understand and maintain.
2. **Limited Flexibility**: If the algorithm structure changes frequently, it might be harder to maintain the template method.

### Conclusion

The Template Method Pattern is a powerful tool for defining the skeleton of an algorithm and allowing subclasses to customize specific steps. It promotes code reuse, flexibility, and consistency, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
