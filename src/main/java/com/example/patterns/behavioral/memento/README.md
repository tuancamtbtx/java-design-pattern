The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to save its state so that it can be restored to that state later. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to implement undo/redo functionality.

### Key Concepts

1. **Memento**: An object that stores the internal state of the originator. It should not be accessible to any object other than the originator.
2. **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored.
3. **Caretaker**: The object that requests a save from the originator and keeps the memento. It is also responsible for restoring the originator's state from the memento.

### Example

Let's consider an example where we have a text editor that can save and restore its text content.

#### Memento

```java
public class TextEditorMemento {
    private String state;

    public TextEditorMemento(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }
}
```

#### Originator

```java
public class TextEditor {
    private String text;

    public void setText(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    public String getText() {
        return text;
    }

    public TextEditorMemento save() {
        return new TextEditorMemento(text);
    }

    public void restore(TextEditorMemento memento) {
        this.text = memento.getState();
    }
}
```

#### Caretaker

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class TextEditorCaretaker {
    private Stack<TextEditorMemento> history = new Stack<>();

    public void save(TextEditor textEditor) {
        history.push(textEditor.save());
    }

    public void undo(TextEditor textEditor) {
        if (!history.isEmpty()) {
            textEditor.restore(history.pop());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Client

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor();
        TextEditorCaretaker caretaker = new TextEditorCaretaker();

        textEditor.setText("Hello, world!");
        caretaker.save(textEditor);

        textEditor.setText("Hello, design patterns!");
        caretaker.save(textEditor);

        textEditor.setText("Hello, Memento!");

        System.out.println("Current Text: " + textEditor.getText()); // Output: Hello, Memento!

        caretaker.undo(textEditor);
        System.out.println("After Undo: " + textEditor.getText()); // Output: Hello, design patterns!

        caretaker.undo(textEditor);
        System.out.println("After Undo: " + textEditor.getText()); // Output: Hello, world!
    }
}
```

### When to Use the Memento Pattern

1. **Undo/Redo**: When you need to implement undo/redo functionality.
2. **State Restoration**: When you need to save and restore an object's state without exposing its internal structure.
3. **State Snapshots**: When you need to take snapshots of an object's state to restore it later.

### Benefits

1. **Encapsulation**: Keeps the internal state of the originator encapsulated and hidden from other objects.
2. **Simplifies State Management**: Simplifies the management of state by providing a mechanism to save and restore it.
3. **Flexibility**: Allows for flexible state management, making it easy to implement undo/redo functionality.

### Drawbacks

1. **Memory Overhead**: Can lead to increased memory usage if the state objects are large or if there are many state changes.
2. **Complexity**: Can add complexity to the system, especially if multiple objects need to be managed.

### Conclusion

The Memento Pattern is a powerful tool for saving and restoring an object's state, making it particularly useful for implementing undo/redo functionality. It encapsulates the state management logic, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
