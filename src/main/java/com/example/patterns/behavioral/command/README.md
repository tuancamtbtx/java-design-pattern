The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation allows you to parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

### Key Concepts

1. **Command**: An interface or abstract class that declares a method for executing a command.
2. **Concrete Command**: A class that implements the Command interface and defines the binding between a Receiver object and an action.
3. **Receiver**: The object that performs the actual work when the command's execute method is called.
4. **Invoker**: The object that knows how to execute a command but does not know about the concrete command or the receiver.
5. **Client**: The class that creates the concrete command and sets its receiver.

### Example

Let's consider an example where we have a simple text editor with commands to write text, undo the last operation, and redo the last undone operation.

#### Command Interface

```java
public interface Command {
    void execute();
    void undo();
}
```

#### Concrete Command

```java
public class WriteTextCommand implements Command {
    private TextEditor editor;
    private String text;

    public WriteTextCommand(TextEditor editor, String text) {
        this.editor = editor;
        this.text = text;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        editor.writeText(text);
    }

    @Override
    public void undo() {
        editor.undoWriteText(text);
    }
}
```

#### Receiver

```java
public class TextEditor {
    private StringBuilder currentText = new StringBuilder();

    public void writeText(String text) {
        currentText.append(text);
        System.out.println("Current Text: " + currentText.toString());
    }

    public void undoWriteText(String text) {
        int start = currentText.length() - text.length();
        currentText.delete(start, start + text.length());
        System.out.println("Current Text after undo: " + currentText.toString());
    }
}
```

#### Invoker

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class TextEditorInvoker {
    private Stack<Command> commandHistory = new Stack<>();

    public void executeCommand(Command command) {
        command.execute();
        commandHistory.push(command);
    }

    public void undo() {
        if (!commandHistory.isEmpty()) {
            Command command = commandHistory.pop();
            command.undo();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Client

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextEditor editor = new TextEditor();
        TextEditorInvoker invoker = new TextEditorInvoker();

        Command writeHello = new WriteTextCommand(editor, "Hello ");
        Command writeWorld = new WriteTextCommand(editor, "World!");

        invoker.executeCommand(writeHello);
        invoker.executeCommand(writeWorld);

        invoker.undo();
        invoker.undo();
    }
}
```

### When to Use the Command Pattern

1. **Parameterize Objects**: When you need to parameterize objects with operations.
2. **Queue Requests**: When you need to support queuing of requests.
3. **Support Undo/Redo**: When you need to support undo and redo operations.
4. **Log Changes**: When you need to log changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system crash.

### Benefits

1. **Decoupling**: Decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.
2. **Flexibility**: Makes it easy to add new commands without changing existing code.
3. **Undo/Redo**: Simplifies the implementation of undo and redo operations.
4. **Macro Commands**: Allows you to create macro commands by combining several commands.

### Drawbacks

1. **Complexity**: Introduces additional complexity in the code due to the need for multiple command classes.
2. **Overhead**: May introduce some overhead if the commands are simple and do not require the flexibility provided by the pattern.

### Conclusion

The Command Pattern is a powerful tool for encapsulating requests as objects, allowing you to parameterize methods, queue requests, and support undoable operations. It provides flexibility and decoupling, making it easier to manage complex operations and their execution.
