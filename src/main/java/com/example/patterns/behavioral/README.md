Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They help in managing complex control flow and encapsulating behavior in a way that promotes code reuse and flexibility. Here are some of the key behavioral design patterns:

### 1. Chain of Responsibility
Allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until one of them handles the request.

**Example**: A support ticket system where a ticket can be escalated from a junior support agent to a senior agent, and then to a manager if unresolved.

### 2. Command
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.

**Example**: A text editor where actions like copy, paste, and undo are encapsulated as command objects.

### 3. Interpreter
Defines a grammar for a language and uses an interpreter to interpret sentences in the language.

**Example**: A simple calculator that interprets and evaluates mathematical expressions.

### 4. Iterator
Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

**Example**: Iterating over a collection (like a list or a set) in Java using an iterator.

### 5. Mediator
Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.

**Example**: A chat room where users send messages to a mediator (the chat room) instead of directly to each other.

### 6. Memento
Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, so that the object can be restored to this state later.

**Example**: A text editor with an undo feature that restores previous states of the document.

### 7. Observer
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Example**: A news feed system where users (observers) are notified of new articles posted by the publishers (subjects).

### 8. State
Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

**Example**: A TCP connection that changes its behavior based on its state (e.g., Established, Listening, Closed).

### 9. Strategy
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

**Example**: A sorting algorithm where you can switch between different sorting strategies (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort).

### 10. Template Method
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

**Example**: A data processing template where the steps to read, process, and write data are defined, but the processing logic is left to subclasses.

### 11. Visitor
Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

**Example**: A file system where operations like compressing, encrypting, and indexing are implemented as visitors.

### 12. Interpreter
Given a language, defines a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

**Example**: SQL query interpreters or regular expression evaluators.

### Example: Chain of Responsibility

Let's consider an example where we have a logging system that can log messages at different levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR). The request for logging starts at the lowest level and propagates up the chain until it is handled.

#### Handler Interface

```java
public abstract class Logger {
    public static int INFO = 1;
    public static int DEBUG = 2;
    public static int ERROR = 3;

    protected int level;
    protected Logger nextLogger;

    public void setNextLogger(Logger nextLogger) {
        this.nextLogger = nextLogger;
    }

    public void logMessage(int level, String message) {
        if (this.level <= level) {
            write(message);
        }
        if (nextLogger != null) {
            nextLogger.logMessage(level, message);
        }
    }

    abstract protected void write(String message);
}
```

#### Concrete Handlers

```java
public class InfoLogger extends Logger {
    public InfoLogger(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    protected void write(String message) {
        System.out.println("InfoLogger: " + message);
    }
}

public class DebugLogger extends Logger {
    public DebugLogger(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    protected void write(String message) {
        System.out.println("DebugLogger: " + message);
    }
}

public class ErrorLogger extends Logger {
    public ErrorLogger(int level) {
        this.level = level;
    }

    @Override
    protected void write(String message) {
        System.out.println("ErrorLogger: " + message);
    }
}
```

#### Client

```java
public class Client {
    private static Logger getChainOfLoggers() {
        Logger errorLogger = new ErrorLogger(Logger.ERROR);
        Logger debugLogger = new DebugLogger(Logger.DEBUG);
        Logger infoLogger = new InfoLogger(Logger.INFO);

        infoLogger.setNextLogger(debugLogger);
        debugLogger.setNextLogger(errorLogger);

        return infoLogger;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Logger loggerChain = getChainOfLoggers();

        loggerChain.logMessage(Logger.INFO, "This is an information.");
        loggerChain.logMessage(Logger.DEBUG, "This is a debug level information.");
        loggerChain.logMessage(Logger.ERROR, "This is an error information.");
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

Behavioral design patterns are essential for creating flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. They help manage complex control flows and interactions between objects, making the system easier to understand and extend.
