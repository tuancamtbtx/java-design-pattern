The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object (the mediator) that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows their interaction to be varied independently.

### Key Concepts

1. **Mediator**: An interface that defines methods for communicating with colleague objects.
2. **Concrete Mediator**: A class that implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between colleague objects.
3. **Colleague**: An interface or abstract class that defines methods for interacting with the mediator.
4. **Concrete Colleague**: A class that implements the Colleague interface and interacts with other colleagues through the mediator.

### Example

Let's consider an example where we have a chat room where users can send messages to each other. The chat room acts as the mediator that facilitates communication between users.

#### Mediator Interface

```java
public interface ChatMediator {
    void sendMessage(String message, User user);
    void addUser(User user);
}
```

#### Concrete Mediator

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class ChatRoom implements ChatMediator {
    private List<User> users;

    public ChatRoom() {
        this.users = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    @Override
    public void addUser(User user) {
        this.users.add(user);
    }

    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message, User user) {
        for (User u : this.users) {
            // Don't send the message to the sender
            if (u != user) {
                u.receive(message);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Colleague Interface

```java
public abstract class User {
    protected ChatMediator mediator;
    protected String name;

    public User(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        this.mediator = mediator;
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void send(String message);
    public abstract void receive(String message);
}
```

#### Concrete Colleague

```java
public class ChatUser extends User {
    public ChatUser(ChatMediator mediator, String name) {
        super(mediator, name);
    }

    @Override
    public void send(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " sends: " + message);
        mediator.sendMessage(message, this);
    }

    @Override
    public void receive(String message) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " receives: " + message);
    }
}
```

#### Client

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChatMediator chatRoom = new ChatRoom();

        User user1 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "Alice");
        User user2 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "Bob");
        User user3 = new ChatUser(chatRoom, "Charlie");

        chatRoom.addUser(user1);
        chatRoom.addUser(user2);
        chatRoom.addUser(user3);

        user1.send("Hello, everyone!");
        user2.send("Hi, Alice!");
        user3.send("Hey, Alice and Bob!");
    }
}
```

### When to Use the Mediator Pattern

1. **Complex Communication**: When the communication between a set of objects is complex and you want to simplify this communication.
2. **Loose Coupling**: When you want to promote loose coupling between interacting objects.
3. **Independent Interaction**: When you want to vary the interaction between objects independently.

### Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies the communication between objects by centralizing the interaction logic in a mediator.
2. **Loose Coupling**: Promotes loose coupling between colleague objects, making the system easier to maintain and extend.
3. **Single Responsibility**: Encapsulates the interaction logic in a single place, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

### Drawbacks

1. **Mediator Overload**: The mediator can become overly complex if it handles too many interactions, leading to a "god object" that is difficult to maintain.
2. **Single Point of Failure**: The mediator becomes a single point of failure, and if it fails, the entire system's communication can be disrupted.

### Conclusion

The Mediator Pattern is a powerful tool for managing complex interactions between objects by centralizing the communication logic in a mediator. It promotes loose coupling and simplifies the system's design, making it easier to maintain and extend.
